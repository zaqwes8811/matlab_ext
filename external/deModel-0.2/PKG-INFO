Description: The Python package deModel provides a fixed point data
        type for Python, allowing the development of algorithm models in fixed
        point arithmetic. The basic data type is represented by the class
        DeFixedInt, which stores data as an integer and keeps information about
        the decimal point. When performing basic arithmetic operations with this
        data type, the decimal point is adjusted based on some fundamental rules
        of fixed point arithmetic.
